Welcome! Thanks for checking out A Measure of Care. You are invited to contribute to the data set I've started, and help shape the values that go into highlighting who is included, and why. 

**Part I: Explore**

Use my website to look for remarkable people in the Library of Congress' collections who did not receive obituaries in The New York Times until the launch of their Overlooked feature in 2018. See the ways in people may be missing, hard to find, or not as represented as their counterparts.

**Part II: Add**

Then take a moment to give one person an exhibition on the Library of Congress' website. A chrome extension will be available, with more to follow.

**Part III: Contribute**

You are  encouraged to contribute to the data set behind this project. There are a few ways to do so:
+ Use Github to push and pull your edits.
+ Download the excel sheet, make your changes, and send them to me.
+ Help me build more chrome extensions.

We'd probably have to talk a little bit about how to find the info that goes into the data set, and I'm happy to do so.

You are also encouraged to help me shape the values that go into highlighting who is included, and why. Please reach out to me.
